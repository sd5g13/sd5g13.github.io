	abstract={Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) is one of the dominant CMOS aging mechanisms. It causes time-dependent variation, threatening circuit lifetime reliability. BTI-induced circuit errors are not detectable at the fabrication stage. On-line monitoring schemes are therefore necessary to capture the degradations during the operational time. Traditional aging monitoring techniques exhibit high implementation complexity and low stability. In this paper, we propose a BTI monitoring approach by simply tracking the start-up behavior of SRAM cells. SRAM is a widely used on-chip device in many applications. We study the impact of BTI for SRAM start-up values and age some cells in a manipulated manner. The BTI degradation is evaluated based on the number of SRAM cells starting with a certain value. This technique can be used to estimate the degradation for on-chip logic circuits without introducing additional circuitry, and thus has very low implementation complexity. We use an SRAM array with 1024 cells to estimate the degradations for multiple logic circuits, and show the average mean absolute percentage error as 8.48%. In addition, this technique is robust considering process, voltage and temperature variations.},

	abstract={Distributed arithmetic (DA) brings area and power benefits to digital designs relevant to the Internet-of-Things. Therefore, new error resilient techniques for DA computation are urgently required to improve robustness against the process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. This paper proposes a new in-situ timing error prevention technique to mitigate the impact of variations in DA circuits by providing a guardband for significant (most significant bit) computations. This guardband is initially achieved by modifying the sign extension block and carefully gate-sizing. Therefore, least significant bit (LSB) computation can correspond to the critical path, and timing error can be tolerated at the cost of acceptable accuracy loss. Our approach is demonstrated on a 16-tap finite impulse respons (FIR) filter using the 65 nm CMOS process and the simulation results show that this design can still maintain high-accuracy performance without worst case timing margin, and achieve up to 32% power savings by voltage scaling when the worst case margin is considered with only 9% area overhead.},
